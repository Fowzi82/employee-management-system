# Employee Management System
An efficient management system that I created in the second semester for my course Data Structures and Algorithms.

## Overview
Welcome to the Employee Management System (EMS), a software solution designed to efficiently manage employee data for organizations. Utilizing the power of B-trees, EMS ensures fast and reliable operations for storing, searching, updating, and retrieving employee records.

## Features
- **Efficient Disk Access**: Minimized disk access with balanced tree depth.
- **Sorted Data Storage**: Fast search operations with sorted data.
- **Scalability**: Maintains balance with large datasets.
- **Non-Sequential Data Access**: Handles non-sequential data efficiently.
- **Dynamic Data Updates**: Efficient insertions and deletions.

## How to Use
### View Current Employees

- Accessible via the "View all Employees" button.

### Add an Employee

- Fill out the form fields (ID, name, salary, position, email, address) and click "Submit".

### Update Employee Information
